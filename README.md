# Hotel_Demand-SHAP-visualization

In this project, I am using the Kaggle Hotel Demand Dataset (). My focus in this project was not on model selection, tuning or evaluation. This is an example of how to use SHAP to explain the predictions of your model. I am using a Random Forest Regression model and using the Kernel Explainer to show how each feature contributes to the prediction.
